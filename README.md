# rusty-calculator
Rusty calculator is a simple parser of basic arithmetic matematical operations. It can currently handle:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Powers

Planned features include:

* Brackets
* Roots
* Variables
* Terminal interface module
* Graphical interface module, maybe using a libui or gtk wrapper

## Dependencies
Rusty calculator currently has no dependencies other than the rust standard library. Different interfaces may be added that have their own dependencies, such as gui toolkits.
